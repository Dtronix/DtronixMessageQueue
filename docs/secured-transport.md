## Overview
DtronixMessageQueue utilizes a custom transport protocol which utilizes several of the technologies used in the TLS protocol.  A full blown TLS protocol is a little overkill since authentication and encryption negotiation is not required. Forward-security is a corner stone of this transport protocol.  To facilitate that functionality the Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange methods are used with ephemeral keys generated for each connection.


## Protocol
### Records
Records are used to define the state of the protocol, send alerts and transport data
